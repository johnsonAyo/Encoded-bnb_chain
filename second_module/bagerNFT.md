The test uses the Hardhat framework and the Chai assertion library. It creates a new instance of the BadgerNFT contract before each test case using the beforeEach hook. The it block tests that the mint function correctly mints a new NFT and assigns ownership to the correct recipient.

To run this test, you can use the Hardhat command line interface by running npx hardhat test. This will compile your contracts, deploy them to a local Ethereum network, and run your tests.
