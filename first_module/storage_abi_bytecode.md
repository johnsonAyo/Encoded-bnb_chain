An ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a standardized way to interact with a smart contract on a blockchain network. It defines the functions and events that a contract exposes to the network, as well as the data types and arguments that are required for those functions.
In the storage.sol, the functions this abi exposes includes the store function which is nonpayeable and the retrieve function which is a function to view the state of uint value in the contract

Bytecode is the compiled version of a smart contract's code that can be executed by the blockchain. When a smart contract is written in a programming language such as Solidity or Vyper, it needs to be compiled into bytecode that can be executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or similar blockchain engines.

The relationship between a contract's code and its bytecode is that the code is compiled into bytecode. The code is written in a high-level programming language that is easy for humans to read and understand, while the bytecode is a low-level machine-readable code that can be executed by the blockchain.

During the compilation process, the code is transformed into a series of instructions that the EVM can execute. These instructions are then represented in the form of bytecode, which is a hexadecimal string of characters.

When a user deploys a smart contract on the blockchain, they are essentially uploading the bytecode to the network. Once the contract is deployed, the bytecode is stored on the blockchain and can be executed by the EVM whenever a transaction is sent to the contract.

In summary, bytecode is the compiled version of a smart contract's code that can be executed by the blockchain, and it is generated by compiling the high-level code into a low-level machine-readable code.
